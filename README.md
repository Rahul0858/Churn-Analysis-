Objective

In todayâ€™s competitive market, customer retention is more important than ever. This project was developed to understand customer behavior and identify patterns that lead to customer churn. Using a combination of SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning, the goal was to analyze, visualize, and predict whether a customer is likely to leave a company or not.

The project includes:

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Interactive dashboard creation in Power BI.

Predictive modeling using Random Forest algorithm.





About the Data

The dataset used in this project contains detailed customer information including demographics such as gender and senior citizen status, the types of services each customer has subscribed to like internet, phone, and streaming services, as well as account-related details such as tenure, monthly charges, and contract type. One of the key features in the dataset is the churn label, which indicates whether a customer has left the company or not (Yes/No). The raw data was cleaned and processed using SQL in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), where missing values were handled, data types were standardized, and irrelevant or duplicate entries were removed. The final cleaned dataset was then exported for further visualization in Power BI and used for predictive modeling with machine learning.






Conclusion

This project shows how data can be used to:

Identify at-risk customers

Support strategic decision-making

Improve retention by targeting vulnerable segments

The model and dashboard can help businesses proactively reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.
